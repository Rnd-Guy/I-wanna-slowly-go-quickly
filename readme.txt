I Wanna Slowly Go Quickly v1.1.1 - Post Twourney edition
By RndGuy

Made for the I Wanna Tworney
My first full length non-gamejam game \o/
Designed to be on the easier side but that kinda slipped towards the end ^^;


Notes:
- Vod mute warning: A song exists in the game that is confirmed to mute its section in twitch vods and some youtube vods in russia
- If the music is very noticeably offsync, there's a music offset option in the pause menu. Set it to negative if the music is early, or positive if the music is late.



Made in:
Godot 4.2.1
ReloadedK's Godot Fangame Engine v1.3 (with some parts of 1.6)

Source code: https://github.com/Rnd-Guy/I-wanna-slowly-go-quickly


Massive thanks to the Testers:
